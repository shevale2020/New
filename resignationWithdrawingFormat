Hi,

As per our yesterday's discussion related to Withdrawing Resignation. 
I have total 5 + year of experience in software development.Since last 1.2 year I'm working in this organization, I gave my best performance but as per current market standard my salary is too low. I'm expecting at least 9 LPA, 
and also on the expecting amount the discussion is in progress with other organization.
If the WNS is ready to give the expected salary then I am ready to withdraw my resignation.

Thanks,
Swati Shinde
