Better career prospect

I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position here as a Software Developer. I would like to personally thank you for the opportunity you provided me to work alongside you at such a great company. I have learnt many new skills here and wish you and the team all the best for the future.

I want to be completely honest and frank about why I am leaving the company. I have been offered an opportunity at a different company that is better aligned to my career goals.

I have enjoyed being a part of the team and am thankful for the opportunities you have given me during my time here.
